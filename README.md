This Master Branch shows node_modules. This is bad. Check out the other branch to see node modules gone



To remove node_modules
- `touch .gitignore` at root of project
In **.gitignore**
  - node_modules
  - or copy/paste from the class repo's `.gitignore` file
- `rm -rf node_modules`
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m 'removed node modules'`
- `npm i` to return node_modules for local development
- `git push` to your repo and branch


You should no longer see node_modules on github, but you should still see them locally and be able to develop your projected locally.
